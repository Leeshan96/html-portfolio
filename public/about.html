<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a Product designer with background in Business and Management, based in Singapore.</p>

<p>I believe in finding a common ground, marinating both user and business needs as they go hand in hand. That would 
  require having clear understanding through strategic thinking, perception and empathising with users.</p>

<p>I am great at finding little joys in daily life. Always seeking opportunities to explore and going off to adventures to satiate my curiosity.</p>

<p>I love experiencing and immersing myself in new cultures and environments to gain new perspectives, and having an open mind. This brings about 
  endless possibilities and the constant change for self-improvement. And that is why I am here to bring positive changes!</p>
